# Admission checklist - idna_invalid_alabel_001

Facts in the `>` blocks are derived from the upstream Git objects and from this
repository's CI. The builder has reviewed them and signed the sections below.

**The independent-reviewer line is deliberately unsigned** - the
protocol requires a second real person for that, and no second reviewer has looked at
this case. The case is therefore *provisionally* accepted, not paper-grade.

```
Case id:       idna_invalid_alabel_001
Upstream:      kjd/idna
Buggy commit:  c3383c97b3fffd8aa73aaefd16baf9c6da1e9f4e
Fixed commit:  4fdcc18d1eb214b35e16c372e8682fb8b8a52e11
Builder: Hari Kancharla            Build date: 2026-04-09
```

## 1. Provenance
- [x] Full buggy and fixed SHAs recorded; object format recorded.
- [x] Buggy is an ancestor of fixed (ancestry proof recorded).
- [x] Buggy and fixed tree SHAs recorded.
- [x] Parent lists recorded; interval matches the historical-interval policy.
- [x] Selected commit is not a superseded intermediate (or is labelled and justified).

> Measured: object format `sha1`; buggy tree `e4cda51b27ab13bf95f8f20aca0c6bc99381c234`;
> fixed tree `df3eb178220ade293ff0e68933b61f9438296e69`. Ancestry is re-proved on every rebuild by
> `scripts/rebuild_pack.py` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), which CI runs.

## 2. Historical evidence
- [x] Issue and/or PR URLs recorded, with their relationship to the fixed commit.
- [x] A maintainer-grounded statement establishes the behavior as a defect.
- [x] The defect is not inferred from the commit message or PR title alone.

> Recorded: issue https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/109
> PR https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/4fdcc18d1eb214b35e16c372e8682fb8b8a52e11
> Defect evidence: Issue #109 and commit 4fdcc18 ("Raise IDNAError exception on invalid A-label") report that a malformed punycode A-label leaked UnicodeError. test_decode is extended with that A-label and expects IDNAError.

Historical evidence verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 3. Regression reproduction
- [x] Targeted regression test path and function recorded.
- [x] Buggy run fails for the intended behavioral assertion; failing assertion recorded.
- [x] Fixed run passes.
- [x] Exact Python and dependency versions and the exact command recorded.
- [x] Reproduction label recorded.

> Measured: `tests/test_idna.py` :: `test_decode`.
> CI verdict **VERIFIED** - baseline_fails=pass, reference_passes=pass,
> deterministic=pass across 3 runs.
> Environment: Python 3.11, pytest 8.3.5, network none.

Regression reproduction verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 4. Path classification
- [x] Complete diff name-status recorded; every path classified.
- [x] No unclassified generated/doc/config path.
- [x] Selectors and tests root recorded.

> Measured changed paths: `idna/core.py`, `tests/test_idna.py`
> Selectors: `idna`; tests root `tests`.

Path classification verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 5. Execution environment
- [x] Networking disabled. No credentials, external services, or submodules.
- [x] No third-party pytest plugin beyond the pinned image.
- [x] Every runtime dependency pinned in the image lock and justified.

> Measured: image `realfix-pilot:2`, network `none`, plugins `none`,
> submodules `none`, extra deps: none.

Execution environment verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 6. Task-surface leakage
- [x] Ground-truth vocabulary checked against tests, comments, filenames, patch wording.
- [x] Scoring fields paraphrase rather than copy distinctive terms.
- [x] Strict contamination lint passes.
- [x] Leakage risk recorded low / medium / high with justification.
- [x] No upstream comment or test deleted or rewritten to pass lint.

> Measured: `arena lint-cases --strict` passes on this pack in CI.
> Analysis: Reviewer-visible surfaces expose A-label decode vocabulary (punycode decode in ulabel; the covering method is test_decode). Ground truth paraphrases the defect ("malformed label", "punycode decode") and is checked by strict contamination lint.
> Leakage risk: **low** - ground-truth wording paraphrases the defect and strict contamination lint passes.

Task-surface leakage verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 6b. Historical exposure
- [x] Upstream fix date, issue/PR public date, benchmark publication date recorded.
- [x] Exposure risk recorded with justification.
- [x] Collection-vs-model-release relationship recorded.
- [x] Retrieval-during-evaluation recorded.

> Measured: upstream fix date `2021-10-03`, read from the commit object by the
> importer and carried in the case's `origin` block.
> Exposure risk: **high** - the fix has been public since 2021-10-03, long enough to be well represented in any corpus scraped from GitHub.

Historical exposure verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 7. Mutation
- [x] Mutation run recorded with limit and viable-mutant count.
- [x] Kill rate recorded, or "zero viable mutants" recorded explicitly.
- [x] Zero mutation evidence not presented as a measured kill rate.
- [x] No mutants manufactured, no hidden tests added.

> Measured on `realfix-pilot:2` at limit 25: **76% kill on 25 mutants**.

Mutation verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 8. Licensing
- [x] Upstream SPDX and license-file blob SHAs at the pinned commit recorded.
- [x] Exact pinned license texts vendored (all files for dual licences).
- [x] NOTICE / AUTHORS / data-licence requirements checked.
- [x] Per-case third-party notice recorded; nothing relicensed.

> Measured SPDX: `BSD-3-Clause`
  - `LICENSE.md` blob `b6f87326ffb36158c33f5e6dc9d6175262050cea`
> Each vendored file was hashed and matches the upstream blob at the pinned commit.
> Blobs identical at both commits: True.

Licensing verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 9. Deterministic rebuild
- [x] Two consecutive rebuilds produce byte-identical content and `pack.sha256`.
- [x] Licence and notice files are covered by `pack.sha256`.

> Measured: CI rebuilds every case from its upstream clone and fails the build unless
> `git diff --exit-code` on the pack is empty.

Deterministic rebuild verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09

## 10. Control behavior
- [x] `reference-patch` validates the case.
- [x] Bad, malformed and no-patch controls do not validate it.
- [x] Keyword-gamer obtains no validated repair.

> Measured: CI's Controls step asserts reference-patch validates all cases and that
> `control:bad_patch`, `control:malformed_patch`, `control:detects_no_patch` and
> `control:keyword_gamer` validate none.

Control behavior verified by: Hari Kancharla   Date: 2026-04-09
