# Admission checklist - more_itertools_numeric_range_reversed_empty_001

Facts below are machine-derived from the upstream Git objects and from this
repository's CI. **Tick boxes and initials are left blank on purpose**: this file
records what was measured, not that a person has reviewed it. Per the protocol,
automation cannot sign these sections.

```
Case id:       more_itertools_numeric_range_reversed_empty_001
Upstream:      more-itertools/more-itertools
Buggy commit:  247e15b3a489d5805375c95dfa79486c9bd0eb1b
Fixed commit:  edb3346f835ca917efbfda5e2d6664ab952da369
Builder: ______________________   Build date: _________
```

## 1. Provenance
- [ ] Full buggy and fixed SHAs recorded; object format recorded.
- [ ] Buggy is an ancestor of fixed (ancestry proof recorded).
- [ ] Buggy and fixed tree SHAs recorded.
- [ ] Parent lists recorded; interval matches the historical-interval policy.
- [ ] Selected commit is not a superseded intermediate (or is labelled and justified).

> Measured: object format `sha1`; buggy tree `392f25c876c1508ba07c0d4617ec30ea397b6c76`;
> fixed tree `a63466f36f56812a62b8e9262b5c4aa949baead9`. Ancestry is re-proved on every rebuild by
> `scripts/rebuild_pack.py` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), which CI runs.

Provenance verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 2. Historical evidence
- [ ] Issue and/or PR URLs recorded, with their relationship to the fixed commit.
- [ ] A maintainer-grounded statement establishes the behavior as a defect.
- [ ] The defect is not inferred from the commit message or PR title alone.

> Recorded: issue None
> PR https://github.com/more-itertools/more-itertools/commit/edb3346f835ca917efbfda5e2d6664ab952da369
> Defect evidence: Commit edb3346 ("Fix empty ranges in numeric_range.__reversed__") adds test_empty_reversed, which requires reversed(numeric_range(0)) to yield no values instead of raising. No separate issue was filed; the commit and its regression test establish the defect.

Historical evidence verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 3. Regression reproduction
- [ ] Targeted regression test path and function recorded.
- [ ] Buggy run fails for the intended behavioral assertion; failing assertion recorded.
- [ ] Fixed run passes.
- [ ] Exact Python and dependency versions and the exact command recorded.
- [ ] Reproduction label recorded.

> Measured: `tests/test_more.py` :: `test_empty_reversed`.
> CI verdict **VERIFIED** - baseline_fails=pass, reference_passes=pass,
> deterministic=pass across 3 runs.
> Environment: Python 3.11, pytest 8.3.5, network none.

## 4. Path classification
- [ ] Complete diff name-status recorded; every path classified.
- [ ] No unclassified generated/doc/config path.
- [ ] Selectors and tests root recorded.

> Measured changed paths: `more_itertools/more.py`, `tests/test_more.py`
> Selectors: `more_itertools`; tests root `tests`.

## 5. Execution environment
- [ ] Networking disabled. No credentials, external services, or submodules.
- [ ] No third-party pytest plugin beyond the pinned image.
- [ ] Every runtime dependency pinned in the image lock and justified.

> Measured: image `realfix-pilot:2`, network `none`, plugins `none`,
> submodules `none`, extra deps: none.

Execution environment verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 6. Task-surface leakage
- [ ] Ground-truth vocabulary checked against tests, comments, filenames, patch wording.
- [ ] Scoring fields paraphrase rather than copy distinctive terms.
- [ ] Strict contamination lint passes.
- [ ] Leakage risk recorded low / medium / high with justification.
- [ ] No upstream comment or test deleted or rewritten to pass lint.

> Measured: `arena lint-cases --strict` passes on this pack in CI.
> Analysis: Reviewer-visible surfaces expose reversed-empty vocabulary (__reversed__ indexing the last element; the new test is named test_empty_reversed). Ground truth paraphrases the defect ("vacuous span", "empty numeric span") and is checked by strict contamination lint.
> Risk label is a judgment and is left for the reviewer: ____________

## 6b. Historical exposure
- [ ] Upstream fix date, issue/PR public date, benchmark publication date recorded.
- [ ] Exposure risk recorded with justification.
- [ ] Collection-vs-model-release relationship recorded.
- [ ] Retrieval-during-evaluation recorded.

> Measured: upstream fix date `2026-04-10`, read from the commit object by the
> importer and carried in the case's `origin` block.
> Risk label is a judgment and is left for the reviewer: ____________

Historical exposure verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 7. Mutation
- [ ] Mutation run recorded with limit and viable-mutant count.
- [ ] Kill rate recorded, or "zero viable mutants" recorded explicitly.
- [ ] Zero mutation evidence not presented as a measured kill rate.
- [ ] No mutants manufactured, no hidden tests added.

> Measured on `realfix-pilot:2` at limit 25: **100% kill on 25 mutants**.

Mutation verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 8. Licensing
- [ ] Upstream SPDX and license-file blob SHAs at the pinned commit recorded.
- [ ] Exact pinned license texts vendored (all files for dual licences).
- [ ] NOTICE / AUTHORS / data-licence requirements checked.
- [ ] Per-case third-party notice recorded; nothing relicensed.

> Measured SPDX: `MIT`
  - `LICENSE` blob `0a523bece3e50519653c4d7a38399baa487fefa1`
> Each vendored file was hashed and matches the upstream blob at the pinned commit.
> Blobs identical at both commits: True.

Licensing verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 9. Deterministic rebuild
- [ ] Two consecutive rebuilds produce byte-identical content and `pack.sha256`.
- [ ] Licence and notice files are covered by `pack.sha256`.

> Measured: CI rebuilds every case from its upstream clone and fails the build unless
> `git diff --exit-code` on the pack is empty.

Deterministic rebuild verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 10. Control behavior
- [ ] `reference-patch` validates the case.
- [ ] Bad, malformed and no-patch controls do not validate it.
- [ ] Keyword-gamer obtains no validated repair.

> Measured: CI's Controls step asserts reference-patch validates all cases and that
> `control:bad_patch`, `control:malformed_patch`, `control:detects_no_patch` and
> `control:keyword_gamer` validate none.
