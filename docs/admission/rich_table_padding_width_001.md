# Admission checklist - rich_table_padding_width_001

Facts below are machine-derived from the upstream Git objects and from this
repository's CI. **Tick boxes and initials are left blank on purpose**: this file
records what was measured, not that a person has reviewed it. Per the protocol,
automation cannot sign these sections.

```
Case id:       rich_table_padding_width_001
Upstream:      Textualize/rich
Buggy commit:  fe55a131c2780fa856464ad04d7d6dc8a1079b72
Fixed commit:  1c5e03eb32020011f5b13174e186c588d09d749c
Builder: ______________________   Build date: _________
```

## 1. Provenance
- [ ] Full buggy and fixed SHAs recorded; object format recorded.
- [ ] Buggy is an ancestor of fixed (ancestry proof recorded).
- [ ] Buggy and fixed tree SHAs recorded.
- [ ] Parent lists recorded; interval matches the historical-interval policy.
- [ ] Selected commit is not a superseded intermediate (or is labelled and justified).

> Measured: object format `sha1`; buggy tree `08070be2b24ac37b3e39494ca74cf69d76c99a8e`;
> fixed tree `9e243e1651ba7b196b62bb5d17fe6eee9469a862`. Ancestry is re-proved on every rebuild by
> `scripts/rebuild_pack.py` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), which CI runs.

## 2. Historical evidence
- [ ] Issue and/or PR URLs recorded, with their relationship to the fixed commit.
- [ ] A maintainer-grounded statement establishes the behavior as a defect.
- [ ] The defect is not inferred from the commit message or PR title alone.

> Recorded: issue https://github.com/Textualize/rich/issues/3871
> PR https://github.com/Textualize/rich/pull/3935
> Defect evidence: Issue #3871 reports uneven padding between table cells. PR #3935 ("fix for padding width", merged) rewrites Table._get_padding_width to handle collapsed padding and to drop the outer padding of the first and last columns so spacing is consistent.

## 3. Regression reproduction
- [ ] Targeted regression test path and function recorded.
- [ ] Buggy run fails for the intended behavioral assertion; failing assertion recorded.
- [ ] Fixed run passes.
- [ ] Exact Python and dependency versions and the exact command recorded.
- [ ] Reproduction label recorded.

> Measured: `tests/test_table.py` :: `test_padding_width`.
> CI verdict **VERIFIED** - baseline_fails=pass, reference_passes=pass,
> deterministic=pass across 3 runs.
> Environment: Python 3.11, pytest 8.3.5, network none.

## 4. Path classification
- [ ] Complete diff name-status recorded; every path classified.
- [ ] No unclassified generated/doc/config path.
- [ ] Selectors and tests root recorded.

> Measured changed paths: `rich/table.py`, `tests/test_columns.py`, `tests/test_table.py`
> Selectors: `rich`; tests root `tests`.

## 5. Execution environment
- [ ] Networking disabled. No credentials, external services, or submodules.
- [ ] No third-party pytest plugin beyond the pinned image.
- [ ] Every runtime dependency pinned in the image lock and justified.

> Measured: image `realfix-pilot:2`, network `none`, plugins `none`,
> submodules `none`, extra deps: hypothesis 6.140.3 (import-time only).

## 6. Task-surface leakage
- [ ] Ground-truth vocabulary checked against tests, comments, filenames, patch wording.
- [ ] Scoring fields paraphrase rather than copy distinctive terms.
- [ ] Strict contamination lint passes.
- [ ] Leakage risk recorded low / medium / high with justification.
- [ ] No upstream comment or test deleted or rewritten to pass lint.

> Measured: `arena lint-cases --strict` passes on this pack in CI.
> Analysis: Note for the reviewer: the added upstream test is named test_padding_width and the ground-truth concept is "cell padding width". The overlap is upstream's own naming, not introduced here. Strict contamination lint passes.
> Risk label is a judgment and is left for the reviewer: ____________

## 6b. Historical exposure
- [ ] Upstream fix date, issue/PR public date, benchmark publication date recorded.
- [ ] Exposure risk recorded with justification.
- [ ] Collection-vs-model-release relationship recorded.
- [ ] Retrieval-during-evaluation recorded.

> Measured: upstream fix date `2026-01-23`, read from the commit object by the
> importer and carried in the case's `origin` block.
> Risk label is a judgment and is left for the reviewer: ____________

## 7. Mutation
- [ ] Mutation run recorded with limit and viable-mutant count.
- [ ] Kill rate recorded, or "zero viable mutants" recorded explicitly.
- [ ] Zero mutation evidence not presented as a measured kill rate.
- [ ] No mutants manufactured, no hidden tests added.

> Measured on `realfix-pilot:2` at limit 25: **84% kill on 25 mutants**.

Mutation verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 8. Licensing
- [ ] Upstream SPDX and license-file blob SHAs at the pinned commit recorded.
- [ ] Exact pinned license texts vendored (all files for dual licences).
- [ ] NOTICE / AUTHORS / data-licence requirements checked.
- [ ] Per-case third-party notice recorded; nothing relicensed.

> Measured SPDX: `MIT`
  - `LICENSE` blob `4415505566f261c802b671426be529a31f914137`
> Each vendored file was hashed and matches the upstream blob at the pinned commit.
> Blobs identical at both commits: True.

Licensing verified by: __________________  Date: __________

## 9. Deterministic rebuild
- [ ] Two consecutive rebuilds produce byte-identical content and `pack.sha256`.
- [ ] Licence and notice files are covered by `pack.sha256`.

> Measured: CI rebuilds every case from its upstream clone and fails the build unless
> `git diff --exit-code` on the pack is empty.

## 10. Control behavior
- [ ] `reference-patch` validates the case.
- [ ] Bad, malformed and no-patch controls do not validate it.
- [ ] Keyword-gamer obtains no validated repair.

> Measured: CI's Controls step asserts reference-patch validates all cases and that
> `control:bad_patch`, `control:malformed_patch`, `control:detects_no_patch` and
> `control:keyword_gamer` validate none.
